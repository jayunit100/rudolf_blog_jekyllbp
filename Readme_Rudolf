1) The jekyll command will generate this site locally. 

2) In order for pages to be seen, they must match the date format in the _posts/ directory

3) Savvy users will note that the _site directory is in .gitignore ... guess why ? 

4) To deploy to heroku, you push it to heroku after initializing the site .  The 
heroku site is already associated with this repository, and will use your ssh keys, 
which have been added to heroku (by you :)), to validate your submission. 

5) Again, the two commands are 

 PUSH YOUR LATEST CONTENT TO GITHUB

  git push origin master

 DEPLOY THE SITE TO HEROKU 

  git push heroku master
